A tick consists of either scheduling or completing the current pipeline step or counting the current step's tick if the asynchronous work is not yet finished and the configured maximum number of ticks is not reached yet. public bool Tick() Returns bool True if the pipeline has more work to do (and so you should continue calling this method to finish it), false otherwise. Therefore, false could mean the pipeline has failed or that it has finished successfully. Remarks Tick rate is determined by your code and may be both fixed or variable. UnregisterStep(IDBPPipelineStep) Removes a step from the pipeline. You must not remove pipeline steps while the pipeline is running. If you want to remove steps from a pipeline that is running, either let the pipeline finish first or call Reset() on it. public void UnregisterStep(IDBPPipelineStep step) Parameters step IDBPPipelineStep Step to remove from the pipeline. Exceptions ArgumentNullException If step is null. InvalidOperationException If the pipeline is in the middle of a run. InvalidOperationException If step is not in the pipeline.

    "summary": "Interface IDBPPipelineStep Namespace PWS.DungeonBlueprint.Pipeline Interface defining a step of a run of DBPPipeline. All steps the pipeline runs must implement this interface. public interface IDBPPipelineStep Remarks Implement this interface to create a custom pipeline step and register it with the pipeline using RegisterStep(IDBPPipelineStep). Properties IsCompleted Whether this step has been completed. Typically initialized to false, set to true when Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) is called and set back to false when Reset() is called. bool IsCompleted { get; } Property Value bool Remarks This is used to check whether the next action to take is completing the step or continue to the next step of the pipeline. You have control over setting this so you can delay completion. The pipeline will not continue to the next step until this is set to true. IsCurrentJobCompleted Whether the async operation inside this step is completed. This is typically connected to Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.IsCompleted using the job handle created during scheduling of the step, but it can represent the completion state of any asynchronous operation you are running. bool IsCurrentJobCompleted { get; } Property Value bool Remarks If IsScheduled and this return true, the pipeline will call Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) on the step in its tick. This allows the pipeline to finish the step before it has run the configured maximum number of ticks for this stage. Once the maximum number of ticks has been reached, the pipeline will call Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) even if this property is false. If your step runs synchronously, you probably want this to always return true. IsScheduled Whether this step has been scheduled. Typically initialized to false, set to true when Schedule(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) is called and set back to false when Reset() is called. bool IsScheduled { get; } Property Value bool Remarks This is used to check whether the next action to take on this step is scheduling or completing. You have control over setting this so you can delay scheduling. The step will not complete until this is set to true. This also means that resources you may have allocated in a call to Schedule(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) and want to free in Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) will only actually be freed if this returns true. Order Ordering of this pipeline step. This determines the order of the steps within the same stage. Lower order number comes first. If two steps have the same order number, whichever is added to the pipeline first will be executed first. uint Order { get; } Property Value uint Examples If you have 2 custom pipeline steps with the stage Topology, one with order 2 and one with order 11, the pipeline stage topology will have the steps ordered as 1. built-in PWS.DungeonBlueprint.Topology.TopologyStep, 2. custom step with order 2, 3. custom step with order 11. Remarks All built-in steps have order number 0 and are added to the pipeline immediately on object creation. Since this is an uint, you can not have a custom pipeline step with an order number below 0, so you can not have a pipeline step execute before the built-in step of a stage. If you want a custom pipeline step to be executed right before a built-in step, insert it to the prior stage with a high order number (possibly MaxValue) Stage Stage of this pipeline step. This determines when the pipeline executes this step. Order is the same as in DBPPipelineStage. None and Finished are not valid stages for pipeline steps. DBPPipelineStage Stage { get; } Property Value DBPPipelineStage Examples A custom pipeline step with the stage Topology will execute after the built-in PWS.DungeonBlueprint.Topology.TopologyStep and will therefore have access to the TopologyGraph in Schedule(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) and Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState). While the ResolvedMissionGraph will also be available, you should likely not modify it, since changes will not be carried over into the TopologyGraph at this point. Remarks A custom pipeline step is always executed after the built-in step that corresponds to the pipeline stage. Since the built-in steps build the graph data structures of the pipeline, the stage of a custom pipeline step determine which data structures it will have access to. Methods Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) Completes the work for this step. If the step runs asynchronously, this should block until it is completed. If the step runs synchronously, this should do the bulk of the work. bool Complete(ref PipelineData data, ref PipelineState state) Parameters data PipelineData Graph data structures of the pipeline containing the results of the pipeline stages. You have read and write access. state PipelineState Transient state of the pipeline run. You have read and write access. Returns bool Whether the step was successful. If this is true, the pipeline will continue to the next step. If this is false, the pipeline will stop running. Remarks If the step was fully completed, this should typically make IsCompleted return true. Reset() Reset the pipeline step. This should reset all state of the pipeline step and return it to a state that allows scheduling the step again, with different data, even if it was completed previously. void Reset() Schedule(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) Schedule the work for this step. If the step runs asynchronously, this should do everything needed to start the asynchronous work. If the step runs synchronously, you may do any preparation you need here, but do the bulk of the work in Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState). void Schedule(ref PipelineData data, ref PipelineState state) Parameters data PipelineData Graph data structures of the pipeline containing the results of the pipeline stages. You have read and write access. state PipelineState Transient state of the pipeline run. You have read and write access. Remarks When a step is scheduled, it is guaranteed that Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) will be called. However, the pipeline will check IsScheduled to see if a step was scheduled, and that property is in your control. This means that if you need Complete(ref PipelineData, ref PipelineState) to be called (for example if you allocated native memory and need to free it), you must make IsScheduled return true."

You can get the door index using another query (like GetDoorByGridPositionAndDirection(GridPosition, GridDirection)) or from gameplay events (see RegisterDoorEvents(Transform, DoorPassHandler)). public FixedString64Bytes GetDoorName(int door) Parameters door int Door you want to get the name of. Returns FixedString64Bytes Name of the door. Use Unity.Collections.FixedString64Bytes.ToString() if you need a normal string. Exceptions InvalidOperationException If the world is not set up. ArgumentOutOfRangeException If the given door does not exist. GetGridPositionFromWorldPosition(Vector3) Turns the given world position into the corresponding grid position using DungeonOriginWorldPosition and RoomGridToWorld. public GridPosition GetGridPositionFromWorldPosition(Vector3 worldPosition) Parameters worldPosition Vector3 World position to turn into a grid position. Returns GridPosition Grid position calculated from worldPosition. Remarks No validation is done here and the grid position may be invalid (negative sizes or sizes larger than the grid) if the given world position is outside the bounds of the dungeon. GetPathBetween(List<GridPosition>, GridPosition, GridPosition, CanMoveCheckCallback) Gets the path between two rooms and fills it into the given list. public void GetPathBetween(List<GridPosition> pathOutput, GridPosition start, GridPosition goal, CanMoveCheckCallback canMove = null) Parameters pathOutput List<GridPosition> List that will be filled with all rooms along the path. Contains start at index 0 and goal at the last index. start GridPosition Start position of the path. goal GridPosition End position of the path. canMove CanMoveCheckCallback Callback called during pathfinding to check if a move is legal. See CanMoveCheckCallback. If this is null, all moves are considered legal, as long as they stay inside a room or pass through a door between rooms. Remarks You must pass a valid list as pathOutput, which will be filled with the path in this method. This is to avoid managed allocations on every pathfinding query. You likely should reuse the list across queries. pathOutput is cleared by the method. If you pass a delegate instance as canMove, you should make sure its performance impact is as low as possible. It may be called very often. Exceptions ArgumentNullException If pathOutput is null. InvalidOperationException If no path between the rooms exists. This might indicate an invalid graph.

Note that string can be implicitly converted into Unity.Collections.FixedString64Bytes, so you can pass string into this method. repetitionIdx int Optional index of the node if it was inserted repeatedly through a group node. Returns int Room index with the given name and index or InvalidNode if such a room does not exist. Exceptions InvalidOperationException If the world is not set up. GetRoomConnectedToRoom(int, int) Gets the room connected to the given room with the given index. Useful for iterating through all connected rooms of a room. Use GetRoomConnectionCount(int) to find out how many connected rooms there are.

Any current dungeon will be despawned and any events and queries will stop working. You can call Setup(ReadOnly, DBPWorldSettings) again to spawn a new dungeon. public void Reset() Remarks Calling this will invoke OnWorldReset with false as second parameter, indicating that the world instance may be reused. Setup(ReadOnly, DBPWorldSettings) Sets up the world. You must call this before the world can spawn the dungeon. Calling this resets the world so you can just call this again to spawn a new dungeon without calling Reset() manually. However, this will lead to the current dungeon despawning immediately, even if the new dungeon spawns asynchronously. public void Setup(RuntimeGraph.ReadOnly runtimeGraph, DBPWorldSettings settings) Parameters runtimeGraph RuntimeGraph.ReadOnly Runtime graph that contains all information about the dungeon that will be spawned. settings DBPWorldSettings Additional settings needed by the world. Remarks CRITICAL MEMORY LIFETIME WARNING: The world does not copy the memory in runtimeGraph. If the runtime graph instance you pass is disposed, the memory is freed and this world becomes invalid. This happens automatically if this instance was generated through a DBPPipeline and that pipeline is disposed, reset or set up again. To keep the world active while reusing the pipeline, use DeepCopyAlloc(out RuntimeGraph): pipeline.Runtime.DeepCopyAlloc(out RuntimeGraph copy); // Now you own the copy's memory and must dispose it yourself world.Setup(copy.AsReadOnly(), settings); Exceptions InvalidOperationException If runtimeGraph is invalid. InvalidOperationException If settings is invalid. Tick() Runs a single tick of the world. If the world is not set up, this is a noop. A tick consists of continuing the spawning process until IsReady is true, afterward it checks gameplay events you have subscribed to. Therefore, you must continue calling this even after the dungeon is fully spawned, unless you are not using any gameplay events. public void Tick() Remarks The tick rate is determined by your code and may be both fixed or variable. Calling this does nothing if the world is not set up. TryGetRoomByEntryPortalName(FixedString64Bytes, out int) Tries to get the room that was connected to an entry portal with the given name in the mission graph the dungeon was generated on. public bool TryGetRoomByEntryPortalName(FixedString64Bytes portalName, out int room) Parameters portalName FixedString64Bytes Entry portal name to find the room for. Note that string can be implicitly converted into Unity.Collections.FixedString64Bytes, so you can pass string into this method. room int Output parameter that will contain the room index of the room that was connected to the given entry portal if the node was connected to one, otherwise InvalidNode. Returns bool True if portalName was the name of an entry portal a room was connected to in the mission graph, otherwise false.
